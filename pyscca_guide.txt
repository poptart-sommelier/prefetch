parsing windows 10 prefetch files:
the compression algorithm used is xpress-huffman. microsoft has released some source code and implementations,
which people have adapted to python, via c-bindings.

one package that does this is:
libscca

installing libscca is not straightforward. here's what i did:
1) go to this page:
https://github.com/libyal/libscca/wiki/Building

the author recommends NOT downloading the source code package, but instead downloading the "source distribution package",
which they link to near the top:
https://github.com/libyal/libscca/wiki/Building#source-distribution-package
look for "libscca-[version].tar.gz"

2) extract it to a folder

3) at the bottom of the doc page
https://github.com/libyal/libscca/wiki/Building

they describe "using setup.py", which can be used to create a build that is just meant for c->python bindings

4) switch to the root of the uncompressed directory, and you'll find setup.py.
run the commands detailed on that page (good idea to create a venv first)

python -m venv venv

./venv/bin/activate or venv\scripts\activate
python setup.py build
python setup.py install

5) you can now import the project
import pyscca
